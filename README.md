![alt tag](http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/GraphicsLib/Demos/SimpleNGL.png)

This is the most basic version of an NGL demo, it creates a simple window in Qt and allows
the manipulaiton of the teapot using the mouse.

Note this version has now been modified to use glsl #version 330 so it works with the latest Mesa3D drivers and Intel HD gpu's. If you want to use the latest glsl versions just change the #version
